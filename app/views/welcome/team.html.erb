        <h5>Race details</h5>
        <li>Cost - £8 per racer per race. £3 for ski and/or boot hire NOTE the skis we hire are recreational skis not race skis</li>
        <li>Teams of 3 or 4. Skiers need to be able to competently ski from the top of our slope and get round gates. This race is designed as an introduction to racing.</li>
        <li>Age categories. Under 10 (born after October 1st 2001), Under 13 (born after October 1st 1998), Under 19 (born after October 1st 1992), Under 99 any age!</li>
        <li>You may ski up an age category but not down e.g. a 12 year old could ski in the U19s.</li>
        <li>Teams can be all girls, all boys or mixed.</li>
        <li>Each team needs a team captain who will where the bib for their team and be responsible for getting their team to the start ready for their race. The teams do not need to have the same racers in each month but the team name will stay the same. A club can have as many teams as they want and we appreciate some teams may not race every month</li>
        <li>Race office opens at 8am. Collect team bibs and rented kit after you have paid. Open practice 8.15 to 9.10. Racing begins at 9.20 and finishes before 12 noon (we have to clear the slope for 12 as there are lessons on)</li>
        <li>Each team will have 6 races against other teams in their age category.</li>
        <li>4 points for a win, 2 points for completing the course successfully. So if a team of 4 races a team of 3 the 4th racer must complete the course.</li>
        <li>Medals awarded to the first 3 teams in each age category on each race day. Overall the best 4 results to count towards the perpetual shields awarded in March.</li>
        <li>IMPORTANT entries must be in by midnight the Thursday before the race. If a team subsequently pulls out then the planned race will go ahead, the remaining team must complete the course to win.</li>
        <li>The BBQ will be running as usual and the snack bar for drinks and sweets.</li>
