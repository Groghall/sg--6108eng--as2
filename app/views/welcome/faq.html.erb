        <h3>How can I learn how to ski?</h3>
        <p>We welcome all levels of skiers to join our club. If you are a complete beginner then we run lessons, in blocks of three weeks, during the ski season that you are welcome to attend once you have joined the club. Check the club sessions page for details of the next start date. You may want to arrive 10-15 minutes early to get your skis and boots sorted out.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to register for one of your beginner courses?</h3>
          <p>No. We currently don’t require registration at the moment as we have always been able to cope with the demand. This is always under review and may change if too many people start turning up.</p>

        <h3>Why do you need to know my weight?</h3>
